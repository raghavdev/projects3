<h4>How about the purge module then?</h4>
<p>The purge module has been created for this very purpose yet isn't currently
designed with the Acquia platform in mind and makes it therefore difficult
to setup purging. While the purge module contributor and I work together to
improve version 2.x of Purge this module serves as the go-to point for the
interim. This module will get a dependency on purge and become its plugin in the
future.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installing the project is fairly simple, just download the project as any other
Drupal.org project and enable it on whichever environment you are. Please *note*
that the module only works when using your site on Acquia Cloud and stays
silent and harmless elsewhere. By default the cache purging notifications are
enabled allowing you to immediately test the purging when enabled. You will also
need to install the expire module.</p>

<h2>Maximizing the effects of proactive purging</h2>
<p>When you install this module together with the expire module about 90% of all
changing objects within your site are detected, such as nodes, taxonomy tags
and menu items. Although the expire module does a hard job on detecting
everything in your site it might not always be aware of your site specific
features like news sections or dynamic blocks on your front page.</p>

<p>A couple of examples you could run into:
<ul>
  <li>Nodes of type news get purged yet the paged view on /news is missed. You
   would probably also like to purge the first few sub pages, e.g.:
   /news?page=1, /news?page=2, /news?page=3</li>
  <li>You have job descriptions in a tagcloud on your front page ("<front>") and
   whenever new taxonomy tags are added to the jobs vocabulary the front page
   is not purged because the expire module doesn't detect it for you.</li>
  <li>Whenever a new user account is added to Drupal the "about our team" page
   on "team" is not being refreshed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>These scenarios are examples of the remaining 10% of things that can't be auto
detected with the expire module and for those custom needs the Acquia Purge
module comes with rules integration built in. By defining a standard rule that
listens to the event you need - for instance changing content of type X - you
can fire the "Purge a path from Varnish on Acquia Cloud" action on paths like
"news" and "news?page=1". By enabling the on-screen logging facility you can
quickly test your rules or rely on your log files.</p>

<h4>Once it works and runs in production</h4>
<p>With Varnish load balancing your site and proactive purging in place you can start increasing the "<em>Minimum cache lifetime</em>" and "<em>Expiration of cached pages</em>" values. For instance by putting these settings to a couple of hours or even a day your web servers will only work for authenticated traffic and pages that have just been purged and thus increases the effective usage of what your platform provides significantly.</a>

<h4>API level integration</h4>
<p>In case you need code level integration for some reason we either advise you
to contribute to the expire module or if your needs are very site specific, to
leverage the API functions that Acquia Purge exposes. If you need it you can
send your path or list of paths to these helper functions:</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>acquia_purge_purge_path</b> <i>($path, $domains = NULL)</i></li>
  <li><b>acquia_purge_purge_paths</b> <i>($paths, $domains = NULL)</i></li>
  <li><b>acquia_purge_purge_node</b> <i>(&$node, $domains = NULL)</i></li>
</ul>
</p>
