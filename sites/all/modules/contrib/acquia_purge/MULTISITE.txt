An important note on multi-site setups.
================================================================================
In most single codebase Drupal sites the automatic purging of your content
should work flawlessly as all the domain names you configured on the "Domains"
section of your Acquia Cloud subscription are automatically purged. However on
a multi-site setup this would mean that this module will also purge content on
different domains then what you are saving for, this is unwanted behavior.

How domain detection works.
================================================================================
The Acquia Purge does quite a hard job in detecting all the domain names on
which copies of your content can exist that should expire and tries to detect
these in a best-efforts manner. The way this determination process works is:

1. Take all hardcoded domains in $conf['acquia_purge_domains'] and stop finding.

If not overridden the automatic detection starts:

2. Take the current HTTP_HOST the user is using to visit the site.
3. Interpret the domain name found in $base_url when it's any different.
4. Interpret any domains (without path) found in sites/sites.php.
5. Take the defined list of domains on Acquia Cloud for the environment running.

What domains are detected?
================================================================================
Once your site is running on Acquia Cloud you can log into your site and go to
Drupal's status report, where the domains that are found will be listed.

Alternatively you can also log into your Acquia Cloud server over SSH and use
the following Drush command from your document root to get the list:
  $ drush ev "print_r(_acquia_purge_get_domains());"

Overriding the automatic detection per site or all sites.
================================================================================
Just like many other settings in Drupal the Acquia Purge module allows you to
define the domain names it should purge from the settings.php your site is
reading from. For instance in a complex multi-site setup you can chose to define
this list and in each inheriting settings.php file you can add the correct
domain names.

/**
 * Override domain detection in Acquia Purge.
 */
$conf['acquia_purge_domains'] = array(
  'subsite.mysite.com',
  'www.subsite.mysite.com',
  'subsite.mysite.de',
  'subsite.mysite.nl'
);
